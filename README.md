Title:

Ephemeris++ â€“ C++ Solar System Simulation & Object Trajectory Planner
Description:

This is my first C++ project, developed over four days, aimed at laying the groundwork for a physics-based simulation to track and predict the trajectories of objects entering our solar system. The current version reads planetary data from JSON files and visualizes planets in static, linear alignment for initial debugging and layout.

The ultimate goal is to simulate orbital mechanics as realistically as possible:

    Planetary Motion: Animate planets based on their actual orbital parameters and real-time positions.

    Object Interaction Physics: Predict trajectories of incoming bodies (e.g., asteroids, comets) as they interact gravitationally with major solar bodies, accounting for collisions, gravitational slingshots, and deflections.

The long-term vision is to build a lightweight physics engine that could serve both educational and scientific modeling purposesâ€”an ideal foundation for learning low-level performance-focused simulation.

    ðŸ”§ Built with: C++ (standard library), JSON parsing, basic spatial modeling.
    ðŸš€ Next Up: Orbital dynamics, object prediction physics, real-time visual simulation.
